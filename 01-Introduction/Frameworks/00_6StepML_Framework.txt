6 step Machine learning framework

1. Problem definition: what problem are we trying to solve?
	1a. Supervised
	1b. Unsupervised
	1c. Classification
	1d. Regression

2. Data: what kind of data do we have?
	2a. Structured data? like csv files with rows and columns?
	2b. Unstructured data? like images or sound files?

3. Evaluation: What defines success for us?
	e.g. We need a model that predicts house prices with 95% accuracy

4. Features: What do we already know about the data?
	Is the data numerical or categorical? 

5. Modelling: Based on our problem and data, what model should we use?

6. Experimentation: How could we improve?
