Types of ML

1. Supervised 

    1a. Classification - e.g. Is this example one thing or another?
    if we have 2 options is  Binary classification.
    if we have 2+ options is multi-class classification

    1b. Regression
    How much will this house sell for? (statistical model prediction of a value)
    How many people will buy this app?

2. Unsupervised: has data but no labels

    2a. Clustering
    e.g. You might have different customer IDs, and you know what they bought
    Using Unsupervised learning you might find patterns and group types of customers based on their behaviour

3. Transfer learning

    e.g. Using a model that identifies car types and using it to identify dogs. The "template" is the same.

4. Reinforcement learning

    Having a computer program, perform some actions and rewarding or punishing depending on the result. 
    e.g. rewarding could be updating the score with +1 if it wins a chess game.
