1. Structured
    
    Usually it comes in similar format, with columns and rows.
    e.g. it might be an excel table with weights, age, gender,
    and the result might be: Does this individual have a heart disease?

2. Unstructured

    The format changes from one sample to another.
    e.g. Audio files, images, emails.

The more data the better.

The data can also divide in two different groups:

A. Static data

    e.g. patient historic data

B. Streaming data

    e.g. stock price
