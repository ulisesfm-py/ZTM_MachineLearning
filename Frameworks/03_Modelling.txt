3 parts to modelling

Training, Validation and Test sets, or the 3 sets

e.g. of the 3 sets: 100 patient records
we split them into training split: 70-80%, validation split: 10-15%, test split: 10-15%

1. Choosing and training a model

    Training data: what kind of algorithm or machine model is better for my problem?

    When choosing a model, not only we have to consider the accuracy, but also the training time.
    Some models work better than others on different problems
    Don't be afraid to try things
    Start small and build up (add complexity) 

2. Tuning a model

    e.g. Random Forest model allows to adjust the number of trees
    e.g. Neural Networks allows to adjust the number of layers

    ML models have hyperparameters that you can adjust
    A model first results aren't its last
    Tuning can take place on training or validation data sets

3. Model comparison

    This happens during the experimentation

    
    When you check the test set, the usual is to have a lower accuracy or performance than the training set
    If the accuracy of the test set is significantly lower than the training set, that is called underfitting
    If the accuracy of the test set is higher than the training set, that is called overfitting

    The ideal model does not under or overfit, it is balanced.
